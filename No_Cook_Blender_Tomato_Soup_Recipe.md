1. Combine olive oil, garlic, onion, oregano, red pepper flakes, bread, tomatoes and their juices, and water or stock in the jar of a high-powered blender. Turn blender on to low speed and slowly increase speed to maximum. Blend until soup is steaming hot and completely smooth, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. If an even smoother soup is desired, press through a fine-mesh strainer or chinois before serving. Serve immediately garnished with herbs and drizzled with olive oil, or chill and serve cold. (Once chilled, you can adjust the texture by whisking in water a tablespoon at a time until desired consistency s reached.)
