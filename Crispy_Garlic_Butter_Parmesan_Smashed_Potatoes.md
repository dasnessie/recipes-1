# Crispy Garlic Butter Parmesan Smashed Potatoes

Crispy Garlic Butter Parmesan Smashed Potatoes are fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, smothered in garlic butter and melted parmesan cheese! Much like buttery and garlicky French fries or crispy hot chips. Those crispy edges that send you over the edge!

**8 people (as a side)**

---

- *1kg* potatoes (Yukon Gold or Carisma)
- A light spray of olive oil
- *3 tablespoons* melted butter
- *4 cloves* garlic, crushed
- *1 tablespoon* fresh chopped parsley
- Kosher Salt and Black Pepper to taste
- *2 tablespoons* Parmesan Cheese

1. Pre-heat your oven to broil (or grill) settings to medium-high heat (about 200Â°C).
2. Place potatoes in a large pot of salted water. Bring to the boil; cook, covered for 30-35 minutes or until just fork-tender. Drain well.
3. Lightly grease a large baking sheet or tray with cooking oil spray. Arrange potatoes onto the sheet and use a potato masher to LIGHTLY flatten the potatoes in one piece (not too hard or they will end up mashed).
4. Mix together the butter, garlic and parsley. Pour the mixture over each potato. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and lightly spray with olive oil spray.
5. Broil (or grill) until they are golden and crispy (about 10-15 minutes). Remove from oven, sprinkle over the parmesan cheese and return to the oven until the cheese is melted.
6. To serve, season with a little extra salt and parsley, and serve immediately.
