## Recipe Notes

This sauce is best served immediately. Use oil instead of almond milk for a creamier sauce.
If you do not have a high powered blender: Pour boiling water on top of almonds and let sit overnight.  Remove skins by pressing the almond between your fingers. The skin should pop off easily. Reduce the amount of water in the recipe to 1/4 cup, then add more if needed to adjust consistency.
